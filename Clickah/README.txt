HENRY'S AUTO CLICKER

Written in Python 3.7.2 by arvigo6015

Using the PyAutoGUI library for mouse control

Clicks a specified location an indefinite amount of times. Hoping in future releases to be able to click a sequence of spaces. Originally designed to automate clicking through my online trainings for my summer job. IDK if its supported
on MacOS or Linux, but it forsure works on Windows 10. I'm also hoping to make it look nicer in the future, but it probably will be pretty hard. Change it how you please but credit me.

Safety Features:
	Common Sense - This controls your mouse, if you screw it up you're toast. Don't try and break it.
	Ctrl+C - if the terminal is in focus, keep pressing Ctrl+C and eventually the program will close
	Top Left - Jerk the mouse to the top left of the screen and it will close
	Task Manager - If all else fails, kill the process in task manager
	Open Source - Full commented code on my Github below
